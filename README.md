# Fund Me

This is a basic solidity smart contract meant for learning purposes. Users can fund 'me' through the smart contract; sending eth to the smart contract that the creator can withdraw at any time. 

In the spirit of community, I share this project with detailed comments that can help any newbie get started creating smart contracts with solidity.
